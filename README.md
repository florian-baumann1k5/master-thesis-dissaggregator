# DemandRegio Disaggregator

The DamendRegio project aims to disaggregate the final energy cosnumption of the sectors
- Industry
- Commercial, Trade and Services (CTS)
- Private Household
into a high spacial and temporal resolution.

This project includes:
- The energy carriers: power, gas, petrol products for the industry and CTS sector
- Power consumption of the private households for electric vehicles


## Structure of the Disaggregator
### General
The Disaggregator is structured in the following way:
- src/pipeline/*: Contains the main functions of the Disaggregator
- src/data_processing/*: Contains the data manipulation functions
- src/configs/*: Contains the configuration files and mappings
- data/output/*: Contains the output data
- data/raw/*: Contains the input data
- src/data_access/*: Contains the data access functions (API client and local file reader)
- src/utils/*: Contains the utility and execution functions




### Consumption
This files contain the functionalitie to disaggregate the consumption on a level of industry sectors and regional_ids.

### Applications
Contains the functionalities to disaggregate the consumption on a level of applications.

### Temporal
Contains the functionalities to disaggregate the consumption on a level of temporal resolution.

### Heat
Contains the functionalities to transfere gas and petrol consumption to hydrogen and electricity consumption (fuel switch)

### EV
Contains two approaches to disaggregate and project the power consumption of electric vehicles in private households.

- WZ                                                    = industry_sector [88 unique sectors]
- WZs e.g. 37-39                                        = industry_sector groups [48 unique groups]
- energy carriers                                       = power, gas, hydrogen, petrol_products
- ags_lk = Allgemeneiner Gemeindeschl√ºssel Landkreise   = regional_id [400 unique regions for 2021 following]
- activity_drivers                                      = Mengentreiber (DISS 4.5.1)
- "source" in the old code                              = energy_carrier



## Concepts
### Industry Sectors /Produktions Bereiche /Wirtschaftszweige (2008)

- 48 industry sector groups
- 88 industry sectors (1-99 without 4, 34, 40, 44, 48, 54, 57, 67, 76, 83, 89)
- 29 industry sectors are building the CTS sector (5-33), the other 58 are building the industry sector

### Regional IDs
Classification of german regions
- 400 regional_ids for 2021 following the AGS_LK
- additional information can be found in the Gemeindeverzeichnis-Informationssystem GV-ISys https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Laender-Regionen/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/_inhalt.html
- can be translated to NUTS3 codes
